# FireworkLauncher

This project will be a safe and fun way to launch fireworks from home.

The end goal is to connect your fireworks of choice into a raspberry pi, connect to the raspberry pi via bluetooth with either an app or a website, and launch the fireworks through the app/website.

# Learning Outcomes
By the end of this we plan to learn:
* version control
* project structure
* CMake
* unit testing
* working collaboratively
* and more!
